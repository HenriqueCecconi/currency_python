# Learning to manipulate URLs with python

This repo is a study repo. I will use it for learning to manipulate URLs and URL parameter with python.

It will consist of "bytebank.com/" a fictional website of currency exchange. As the fictional user uses the website the parameters will change. This way I can practice how to deal with these parameters and act accordingly.
